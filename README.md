## Background

Last year, as with most other businesses, Airbnb was rocked by COVID-19. Multiple news about Airbnb's future headlined several articles as large numbers of cancellations and slow bookings created a massive loss in revenue globally but even more appalling is the situation of its hosts.

With the current situation, the collapse of startups has been prevalent during the pandemic. **Airbnb experienced a booking drop over 70% and cut its half in valuation.**

In the wake of the pandemic, emergence of **dynamic pricing** has become a business strategy for survival.

## Objectives
1. To identify the factors affecting the price of Airbnb listings in the Philippines.

2. To train a machine learning model that identifies a pricing system for PH Airbnb hosts to optimize their listing price.
